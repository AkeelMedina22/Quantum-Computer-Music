    "Since the earliest use of computers, algorithms have been created and used in order to create musical compositions. The kind of algorithm this paper will be focusing on is sequencing rules. A computer is programmed with a certain set of rules that generate a sequence of notes, and they can be in the form of Graphs, Finite State Automata, Markov Chains, etc.\n",

    "The previous examples for the Quantum Random Walk only work in certain spaces given certain conditions. Cubes and Tetrahedrons have a predefined structure that makes the dice representation simple. However, if we try to extend this to other shapes such as a dodecahedron, the dice complexity will increase significantly. To generalize a Quantum Random Walk over any set of sequencing rules, the Basak-Miranda Algorithm makes use of Grover's Search Algorithm to not only construct an equivalent quantum circuit, but also provide a quadratic time speedup. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Grover's Search Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "Grover's Search Algorithm is used to provide a quadratic speedup for the following problem statement: Given f: {0,...,N-1} -> {0,1} such that f(x)=1 for exactly one x, find x.\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, we use this algorithm to return a target state given a large unstructured list. The first step is called Phase Inversion, followed by Inversion about the Mean. The process can be shown in the following figure:\n",

    "The first diagram depicts a superposition of all states. Next, the target state has it's amplitude flipped. Finally, all values are inverted about the mean value. Thus, the target value has the highest amplitude, and after enough repetitions of this process, it is very likely that it will be the measured outcome. \n",
    "\n",
    "Grover's Search Algorithm can be applied in the case of algorithmic music generation via sequencing rules. Firstly, we create a Markov Chain based on our chosen sequencing rules. After assigning each state a vertex and maintaining relevant dictionaries, we can choose the target states that have been predefined by our Markov Chain based on the current vertex we are present on. The output of Grover's Search Algorithm will be only the states that have been defined in our sequencing rules. Repeating this process with a new current vertex will give us a musical composition for any kind of sequencing rules. Not just that, but it provides a quadratic time speedup, as well as naturally assigning equal amplitudes, and thus probabilities, to our target states. "

    "To conclude this paper, I will firs summarize the main results and takeaways from this project. The main goal throughout all this was to generate a musical composition. This comprises of, but is not limited to, notes and rhythyms. As an extra result, musical composition containing purely chords was also created for a Quantum Random Walk over a Cube. Moving on to theh more complex sequencing rules, Grover's Algorithm was implemented to generate a musical composition. However, there were issues in implementation, and the resulting circuit produces incorrect transitions between states, based on predefined sequencing rules. \n",
    "One of the main results from this project, however, is that a quantum circuit was able to be generated for a Tetrahedron. The cited and followed research paper creates a quantum dice for a cube, and it is possible to create quantum dice for other figures. Further research could be conducted on generalising the idea of a quantum die over platonic solids (tetrahedron, cube, etc.). \n",
    "Using SonicPi for music creation allows for much more creativity, especicially over the traditional method of 'beep-ing' the frequency corresponding to a note. SonicPi allows for chords to be played without mentioning the corresponding notes. It allows simultaneous playback, and interesting elements such as sustain and bass. \n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, Quantum Computer Music is a new and exciting way of using a well-known algorithm to allow convenience and quadratic time speedup in something one would not expect a Quantum Computer to provide specific use. Miranda and Basak have created an algorithm and exposed the world to a new and creative use of Quantum Circuits. The use of Quantum Dice and Quantum Random Walks could further have use in many different, and possibly unrelated, fields."
