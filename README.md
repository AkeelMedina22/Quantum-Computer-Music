## About The Project

This is the solo final project of Quantum Computing offered by Habib University in Fall 2021.

It was done after following the research paper titled [Quantum Computer Music: Foundations and Initial Experiments](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.12408.pdf), by Miranda and Basak. Their algorithm, the Basak-Miranda algorithm, is the final goal of this paper, and is an algorithm that can produce a musical composition with a quadratic time speedup by making use of Grover's Search Algorithm. Other approaches to generate musical compositions and their results are also present. 

### Built With

* [Qiskit](https://qiskit.org/)
* [Sonic Pi](https://sonic-pi.net/)
* [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/)
* [Python](https://www.python.org/)

### Instructions:

The work in it's entirety is present in the Jupyer Notebook titled 'QCM'. It contains the report, along with the code to create this project.
The folder called SonicPiCode contains text files with code that will produce music if run using Sonic Pi.
Pre-Recorded Music using the code is in the form of a .WAV file in the folder called Demo Music.
